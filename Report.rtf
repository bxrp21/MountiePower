Lightning Round 3 Report

For the most part we tried to keep everything as open as possible. We wanted to give Andy as much of an option to expand his company after his trial run with just the Power Juice. We left the product and the package as general as possible because of this. We used an abstract factory design method so if he decided to implement other types of products he could, but we limited the scope to only DrinkProducts, a subclass of Product, as if he branched out into not drink products he most likely wouldn't want to use the same setup and would probably have to implement another factory that specialized in that products package sizes. We also decided to do this because trying to abstract the factory further without any idea of what the other factories might specifically need to do was hard given the designs we decided to go with.
